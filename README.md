# The sum of a GP

Sum of the first n terms: Sn = a(rn - 1) / (r - 1) when r â‰  1 and Sn = na when r = 1.

1. In the first script_1.js file, the function code that calculates the GP sum using a function expression and uses a loop.

2. In the second script_2.js file, the function code that calculates the sum of a GP using formula for the sum of a geometric progression using the exponentiation operator (**). It takes into account the case where the denominator is 0 (if r = 1) to protect against division by 0.

3. In the third script_3.js file, the function code that calculates the sum of a geometric progression using the formula for the sum of a geometric progression using Math.pow instead of the exponentiation operator (**) and also considers the case where r = 1.
